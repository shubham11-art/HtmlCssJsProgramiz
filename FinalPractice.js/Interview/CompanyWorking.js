//***// SDLC Models
// Software Developement Life Cycle(Process Model)
// Sequence of phases or steps to develope any software.

// 3 Main Stages
// Conception stage (from Problem to Solution)
// Implementation stage (Actual coding)
// Maintainance stage (Upgrade etc)

// SDLC - 5 stage and support an maintainace for some days - Planning/Requrement analysis, design. implement, testing, maintainace.

// Models
// Classical Waterfall
// Iterative Waterfall
// Prototype Model
// Incremental Model (Module by Module, Locked Requirement)
// Evolutionary Model (Module by Module, Flexible Requirement)
// RAD Model (Rapid Application Development) (time and Cost Consteaints, Reusable Component)
// Spiral Model (Risk Evaluated, Large Projects, Small Deve. Team)
// Agile Model (Flexible, Process Divided into Sprints, Parallalism, All working Together- learder all fanda nasato., Startup me ye jyada use hota hai)

// Agile Model (Move Quickly)
// Aadhi kay vhyayach ki ekhadi idea aahe ani mag ti joparyant purn hot nahi toparyant market madhe aanli jayachi nahi. But now, aapan jar ekhadya idea chya mage aahot tar, ti purn karnyapekshya jashi jashi aapan basic pasun development karat jau tas update tya initial/basic model madhe aanal jaat, This is what known as agile.
// Large Projects are broak down in small chunks i.e iterations and try to develope it(parallely), test it and release it. Feedback lenge, if frequired usape kaam karneke baad me firase re-release karenge.

// Defination
// Iterative approach to software developement, to deliver the product incrementlly instead of all at once.

// Phases follows
// Planning - Implementation - Test - Review(yes - build or no - again follow cycle)

// Agile Terminologies
// EPIC - Abstract view of what we are trying to achieve.
// We break down the EPIC into Features and features into Story.
// Stories are divided into Tasks.

// SCRUM Roles
// SCRUM is used in Agile to achieve Software Developement. SCRUM describes Heihrarhy of emplyoee and how they operate to achieve developement.
// Product Owner - Understands the Requirement of customer and convey it to the SCRUM Master and Developement team. Tracks the software developement.
// SCRUM Master - Gluing everything, Planning and breaking down work, Ensure completion.
// SCRUM Team - Developers and Quality Assurance, planning and achieveving the goals, delivering the products.

//*// Daily scrum meeting to discuss present day goals and previous day's task.

// Sprint Activites
// Tasks are completed in a short time frame known as Sprints. i.e with timely delivery of small features we also ensure timely delivery of Larger project.

// Advantages
// Frequent Delivery
// Face to face communication with Client
// Frequent Changes if required
// Time - very less time required.

// Disadvantages
// documentation, negotiations with the client, designing pe kam dhyan hota hai.
// Maintainance Problem hai.
// No proper heiharchy/structure of Manager-Senior Developer-Team etc Sagale Barobar kam kartar. Everyone has freedom to contribute to develope.

//***// JIRA Software
// It is a project management tool and an issue tracker developed by atlassian. JIRA is known for Bug Tracking and Agile Project Management.

// Why JIRA?? and not manually
// Solution for software and team related management
// Can do like - Creating Backlogs, Creating Sprints, Creating Tasks, Status Update, Managing Release, Code integration, Managing Workflows, Can craete own workflow, Integration with 3rd party developement.

// Working
// Craete Team and Assign them Work.
// Create Project and key(short name to refer to project)
// Then inside the project we will create our EPIC - Inside EPIC we can add Stories(With Create issues option) - Issue tyep is STORY.- In the story we can add Summery, Components we created for that story, documents we may want to attach, technical details about the story, Assign option to assign to perticular team member, we assign the priority, You can attach this story to required EPIC, press Create to create the story. - Afetr the Story we will craete Subtasks associated with the story.
// To started with work we will create a sprint. We will provide a duration to that sprint. We can write Sprint goal. Then we will add subtasks to the sprint. Story points assign karaychi. Assignee => who is managing that sprint.
// The way we create Tasks we can create Bug tracker. Bug creation has same options as Story creation.
//**// JIRA madhe we can track - Not started, In progress, pending, testing, done tasks.
// JIRA will show us - Backlogs, Sprints, components, Code integration with repositeries like GitHub, releases, workflows.
// We have Time Tracking for emplyoee management - Time limit perday, perweek etc. Work Tracking.
// Peoples option to craete a Team.
